# Part 1

Using React create a static version of a to-do list web app along with a
detailed component hierarchy including representation of state.

The to-do list should include the following functionality:

* let users add items to the list
* show the total number of items on the list
* the ability to delete items from the list

For this lab you need to do the following:

* Create a mock-up and break it into a component hierarchy.
* Build a static version of your app in React and publish it to the creative server.
* Document the minimal representation of state and in which component it will live in.

This is following the steps in [Thinking in
React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html). Spending time on this
lab and creating a well-documented component hierarchy will help you implement
your web app in the next lab. Please also separately link to your source code as
text files so I can view them.
